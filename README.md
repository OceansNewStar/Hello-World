# Hello-World
Meeting the GitHub Community
I've been studying a bit about coding, in a relative vacuum. However, my aunt tells me that GitHub is a great resource, a virtual necessity. I'm excited to check out the site, the way it works, and the people that interact, here. 
Excited to be joining you guys.
